If you run by downloading, just clicking assignment3.html should work. Alternatively you can just go here to start it.

You can alter the diffusion rates of A and B as well as the feed and kill rates for both.

Ticking on orientation will make diffusion much higher on the right side of the screen.
Ticking on style map will make the feed rate much higher on the bottom of the screen.
